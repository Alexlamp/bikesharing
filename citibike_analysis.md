# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Page 1-3
Through my analysis of the New York Citi bikers I found that the majority can be found in Manhattan. I have determined that the prominance of Citi Bike riders in Manhattan is significantly due to high levels of tourism. Rider's in NYC are typically male, younger than 55 and ride during the hours when the sun is least intense.

Des Moines' population is equally male and female unlike New York's riders whom are majorty male. This could be a market worth breaking into and expanding on in Des Moines. The age of Des Moines' population is mainly 59 years old and younger. This age range is similar to whom ride Citi Bikes the most in NYC.
